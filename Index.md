# RNA-Seq analysis for bacterial gene expression

This is updated at 2021.10.14

Tools for RNA-Seq analysis

* [FastQC](../examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb)
* [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic)
* [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR)
* [RSEM](https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM)


Basic steps
1. Downloading annotation, reference genome, raw data
2. Installing Programs (Fastqc, Trimmomatic, STAR, RSEM)
3. Indexing the genome
4. Mapping the data
5. Quantification: Calculating TPM or FPKM
